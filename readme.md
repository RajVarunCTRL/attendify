EduGuardSystem is a Python application that automates the process of attendance marking using facial recognition. It uses the OpenCV library for webcam access and image processing, the `face_recognition` library for detecting and encoding faces, and PyAutoGUI for a failsafe mechanism to terminate the application safely.
